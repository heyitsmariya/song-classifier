# song-classifier
This is a web app deployed using Flask which predicts the album type (i.e. if a song is a Single, from an Album or a Compilation) based on the user inputted attributes (danceability, valence, energy, accousticness, and more) of the song.

This was a part of the project I did for the unit called Software Technology 1 at the University of Canberra. 


See the #spotify-classifier for the detailed exploratory and predictive data analysis of the dataset.
